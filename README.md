# Game Objective
2 players face off in a simple card game where to goal is to have the highest score by the end of the set turns to be played. Each turn a player draws a card from their deck and plays the card. The value of the card is equal to its face value (I.E. ace => 1, joker => 11, ...). Uppon being played, the value of the card is added to the players total score. Starting player is randomizeds and each deck is also shuffled at the start of game. Decks are composed of 4 suits and 13 cards per suit (Standard deck of playing cards without the jokers).
